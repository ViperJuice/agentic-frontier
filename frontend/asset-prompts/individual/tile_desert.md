# Desert Tile - Complete Prompt

Create a 64x64 pixel isometric desert sand tile for a civilization-building game representing legacy or deprecated code areas in the visualization. Sandy beige/tan colors with subtle dune patterns and occasional small rocks or dried vegetation. The sand should have visible grain texture with slight wind-swept patterns. Must tile seamlessly on all sides.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Size: Exactly 64x64 pixels
- Perspective: Top-down/isometric view (45-degree angle)
- Style: Low-poly aesthetic with warm color tones
- Format: PNG with transparency where applicable
- Edges: Must align perfectly for seamless tiling
- Lighting: Consistent top-left light source

**Color Palette:**
- Primary sand: #F4A460 (sandy brown)
- Shadows: #D2691E (chocolate)
- Highlights: #FFDEAD (navajo white)
- Rock accents: #8B7355 (tan)

**Visual Details:**
- Subtle sand dune ripples running diagonally
- 1-2 small rocks or pebbles
- Wind-swept texture patterns
- Slight grain/particle texture
- Maybe one tiny dried bush or tumbleweed fragment
- Warm, arid feeling
- Clean, stylized look (not photorealistic)
- Saturation: 70-80% to avoid eye strain

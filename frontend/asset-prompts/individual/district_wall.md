# District Wall - Complete Prompt

Create a 64x64 pixel tileable isometric wall segment for enclosing class districts in a code visualization game. Design a modular fortification wall that's 2 stories tall with a walkway on top. Include defensive positions, data shield projectors, and connection points for gates. The wall should clearly define district boundaries while allowing visibility. Must tile seamlessly for creating enclosed areas.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Size: Exactly 64x64 pixels (tileable segment)
- Perspective: Isometric view
- Style: Technical fortress, low-poly
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Edges: Must tile seamlessly horizontally
- Lighting: Consistent top-left light source

**Color Palette:**
- Primary wall: #696969 (dim gray)
- Walkway/top: #808080 (gray)
- Shield projectors: #00CED1 (dark turquoise)
- Connection points: #4B4B4B (dark gray)
- Tech details: #1E90FF (dodger blue)

**Visual Details:**
- 2 stories tall with crenellations
- Walkway visible on top
- Shield projector devices every 20 pixels
- Connection sockets at edges for seamless tiling
- Some defensive turrets or positions
- Tech panels and displays
- Slight transparency to not block view completely
- Modular design that connects smoothly
- Data streams running along wall
- Sturdy but not overwhelming
- Clear edge alignment for tiling

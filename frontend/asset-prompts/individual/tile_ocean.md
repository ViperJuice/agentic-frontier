# Ocean Tile - Complete Prompt

Design a 64x64 pixel isometric ocean/water tile for a civilization-building game representing unexplored areas or external dependencies in a code visualization. Deep blue water with subtle wave patterns and foam caps. The water should have a slight transparency effect with darker depths visible. Include gentle animation-ready wave lines in white/light blue. The tile must be seamlessly tileable on all four sides.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Size: Exactly 64x64 pixels
- Perspective: Top-down/isometric view (45-degree angle)
- Style: Low-poly style with stylized waves
- Format: PNG with transparency where applicable
- Edges: Must align perfectly for seamless tiling
- Lighting: Consistent top-left light source

**Color Palette:**
- Primary water: #4682B4 (steel blue)
- Wave caps/foam: #E0FFFF (light cyan)
- Deep water: #191970 (midnight blue)
- Highlights: #FFFFFF with 30% opacity

**Visual Details:**
- 2-3 visible wave crests with foam
- Depth variation showing darker blues in troughs
- Subtle ripple patterns
- Clean, stylized water (not photorealistic)
- Slight transparency suggesting depth
- Movement suggested through wave direction
- Saturation: 70-80% to avoid eye strain

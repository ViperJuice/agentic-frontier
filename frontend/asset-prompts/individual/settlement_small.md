# Small Settlement - Complete Prompt

Create a 64x64 pixel isometric sprite of a small futuristic settlement representing a small code file (less than 100 lines). The settlement consists of 2-3 small, cubic buildings with glowing windows, connected by thin energy conduits or data streams. Buildings should be low (1-2 stories) with flat or slightly angled roofs featuring solar panels or antenna arrays. The entire settlement should fit within the 64x64 pixel canvas with room for a small plaza.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Size: Exactly 64x64 pixels
- Perspective: Isometric/top-down view
- Style: Futuristic micro-city, low-poly with clean edges
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Foundation: Hexagonal or circular base platform
- Lighting: Consistent cyan/blue for technology elements

**Color Palette:**
- Building walls: #8B4513 (saddle brown)
- Window glow: #00FFFF (cyan)
- Energy conduits: #00CED1 (dark turquoise)
- Base platform: #4B4B4B (dark gray)
- Solar panels: #1E90FF (dodger blue)

**Visual Details:**
- 2-3 small cubic buildings (1-2 stories each)
- Glowing windows suggesting activity
- Thin energy beams connecting buildings
- Small central plaza with data fountain or hologram
- Rooftop antennas and solar panels
- Clean, geometric design
- Visible but subtle data flow effects
- Buildings arranged in small cluster
- Total footprint about 40x40 pixels within canvas

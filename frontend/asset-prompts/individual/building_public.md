# Public Building - Complete Prompt

Create a 64x64 pixel isometric sprite of an open, accessible public building representing a public method/function in code. Design a modern glass and steel structure with transparent walls showing interior workspace. The building should be primarily green with large windows, multiple open entrances, wide stairs/ramps for easy access, and a welcoming plaza area. Include holographic signs indicating 'PUBLIC ACCESS' and data streams flowing in/out freely.

**Technical Requirements:**

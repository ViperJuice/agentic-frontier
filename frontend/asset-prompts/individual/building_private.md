# Private Building - Complete Prompt

Design a 64x64 pixel isometric sprite of a secure, restricted building representing a private method in code. Create a fortress-like structure with solid walls, minimal windows (small and high up), and a single secured entrance with visible access control systems. Use red tones with reinforced corners and security features like cameras, laser grids, and warning signs. Include a data firewall visualization around the perimeter.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Size: Exactly 64x64 pixels
- Perspective: Isometric view showing individual structure
- Style: Futuristic fortress, low-poly emphasizing security
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Lighting: Consistent top-left light source
- Shadow: Drop shadow at 20% opacity

**Color Palette:**
- Primary structure: #DC143C (crimson)
- Reinforced areas: #8B0000 (dark red)
- Security devices: #FFD700 (gold/yellow)
- Firewall effect: #FF4500 (orange red) with glow
- Metal details: #696969 (dim gray)

**Visual Details:**
- 3-4 story solid building with thick walls
- Minimal small windows placed high
- Single entrance with security checkpoint
- Visible cameras on corners
- Laser grid or energy barrier at entrance
- "RESTRICTED" warning signs
- Firewall visualization as energy field
- Reinforced corners with metal plating
- No ground-level windows
- Imposing, secure appearance
- Angular, defensive architecture

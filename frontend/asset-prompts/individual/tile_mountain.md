# Mountain Tile - Complete Prompt

Create a 64x64 pixel isometric mountain/rocky terrain tile for a civilization-building game representing immutable or foundational code infrastructure. Gray rocky surface with angular, low-poly mountain peaks. Include subtle height variation with lighter grays on peaks and darker in valleys. Some small snow caps on highest points. Must tile seamlessly with visible rock stratification.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Size: Exactly 64x64 pixels
- Perspective: Top-down/isometric view (45-degree angle)
- Style: Low-poly with angular, geometric rocks
- Format: PNG with transparency where applicable
- Edges: Must align perfectly for seamless tiling
- Lighting: Consistent top-left light source

**Color Palette:**
- Rock base: #808080 (gray)
- Peak highlights: #C0C0C0 (silver)
- Snow caps: #FFFAFA (snow white)
- Deep shadows: #2F4F4F (dark slate gray)
- Rock layers: #696969 (dim gray)

**Visual Details:**
- 2-3 angular peak formations
- Visible rock stratification/layers
- Small snow caps on 1-2 highest points
- Sharp, geometric edges (low-poly style)
- Clear height variation through shading
- Rugged, solid appearance
- Clean, stylized look (not photorealistic)
- Saturation: 70-80% to avoid eye strain

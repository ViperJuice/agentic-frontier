# Async Dock Building - Complete Prompt

Design a 64x64 pixel isometric sprite of a futuristic dock/port building representing an async function in code. Create a waterfront or space-dock structure in cyan with multiple loading bays, cranes, and conveyor systems. Show cargo containers (data packets) being loaded/unloaded, with some in transit and others waiting. Include animated loading indicators and progress bars on building sides.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Size: Exactly 64x64 pixels
- Perspective: Isometric view showing individual structure
- Style: Industrial port, low-poly with busy aesthetic
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Lighting: Consistent top-left light source
- Shadow: Drop shadow at 20% opacity

**Color Palette:**
- Primary structure: #00CED1 (dark turquoise)
- Loading bays: #4682B4 (steel blue)

- Cranes/equipment: #696969 (dim gray)
- Progress bars: #00FF00 (green) to #FF0000 (red)

**Visual Details:**
- 2-3 story dock building with extended platforms
- Multiple loading bays (3-4) with roll-up doors
- Visible cranes and loading equipment
- Cargo containers in various positions
- Conveyor belts or transport tracks
- Progress indicator bars on walls
- "LOADING" holographic signs
- Ships/vessels docked or approaching
- Busy, industrial atmosphere
- Some containers stacked waiting
- Activity lights blinking

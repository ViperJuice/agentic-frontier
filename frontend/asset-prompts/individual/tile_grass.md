# Grass Tile - Complete Prompt

Create a 64x64 pixel isometric grass tile for a civilization-building game representing fertile development ground in a code visualization game. The grass should be a vibrant emerald green with subtle variations in shade to show texture. Include small details like occasional tiny wildflowers (white and yellow dots), slight grass blade patterns, and gentle color gradients. The tile must be seamless and tileable on all sides.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Size: Exactly 64x64 pixels
- Perspective: Top-down/isometric view (45-degree angle)
- Style: Low-poly art style with clean edges
- Format: PNG with transparency where applicable
- Edges: Must align perfectly for seamless tiling
- Lighting: Consistent top-left light source

**Color Palette:**
- Primary color: #90EE90 (light green)
- Secondary: #228B22 (forest green)
- Accent: Small white (#FFFFFF) and yellow (#FFFF00) flower dots

**Visual Details:**
- Grass texture with visible but subtle blade patterns
- 3-5 tiny wildflowers scattered naturally
- Slight color variation to avoid monotony
- Clean, stylized look (not photorealistic)
- Optimistic, vibrant mood
- Saturation: 70-80% to avoid eye strain

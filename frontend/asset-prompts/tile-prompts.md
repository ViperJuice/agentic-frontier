# Terrain Tile Prompts for Agentic Frontier

## Art Style Guidelines
- **Perspective**: Top-down/isometric view (45-degree angle preferred)
- **Size**: 64x64 pixels
- **Style**: Low-poly, stylized, vibrant colors reminiscent of civilization-building games
- **Mood**: Optimistic, technological, slightly futuristic
- **Color Palette**: Saturated but not overwhelming, with good contrast

## 1. Grass Tile (`tile_grass.png`)
**Prompt:**
"Create a 64x64 pixel isometric grass tile for a civilization-building game. The grass should be a vibrant emerald green with subtle variations in shade to show texture. Include small details like occasional tiny wildflowers (white and yellow dots), slight grass blade patterns, and gentle color gradients. The tile should be seamless and tileable on all sides. Low-poly art style with clean edges. The grass represents fertile development ground in a code visualization game."

**Key Elements:**
- Primary color: #90EE90 (light green)
- Secondary: #228B22 (forest green)
- Accent: Small white/yellow flower dots

## 2. Ocean Tile (`tile_ocean.png`)
**Prompt:**
"Design a 64x64 pixel isometric ocean/water tile. Deep blue water with subtle wave patterns and foam caps. The water should have a slight transparency effect with darker depths visible. Include gentle animation-ready wave lines in white/light blue. The tile must be seamlessly tileable. Low-poly style with stylized waves. This represents unexplored or external dependencies in a code visualization."

**Key Elements:**
- Primary color: #4682B4 (steel blue)
- Wave caps: #E0FFFF (light cyan)
- Deep water: #191970 (midnight blue)

## 3. Desert Tile (`tile_desert.png`)
**Prompt:**
"Create a 64x64 pixel isometric desert sand tile. Sandy beige/tan colors with subtle dune patterns and occasional small rocks or dried vegetation. The sand should have visible grain texture with slight wind-swept patterns. Must tile seamlessly. Low-poly aesthetic with warm color tones. Represents legacy or deprecated code areas in the visualization."

**Key Elements:**
- Primary color: #F4A460 (sandy brown)
- Shadows: #D2691E (chocolate)
- Highlights: #FFDEAD (navajo white)

## 4. Forest Tile (`tile_forest.png`)
**Prompt:**
"Design a 64x64 pixel isometric forest floor tile. Dark green canopy view with multiple small tree tops visible from above. Mix of darker and lighter greens to show depth. Include small gaps showing forest floor (brown). Trees should be stylized and geometric. Seamlessly tileable. Low-poly style. Represents complex, well-developed code modules."

**Key Elements:**
- Tree tops: #228B22 (forest green)
- Shadows: #006400 (dark green)
- Forest floor: #8B4513 (saddle brown)

## 5. Mountain Tile (`tile_mountain.png`)
**Prompt:**
"Create a 64x64 pixel isometric mountain/rocky terrain tile. Gray rocky surface with angular, low-poly mountain peaks. Include subtle height variation with lighter grays on peaks and darker in valleys. Some small snow caps on highest points. Must tile seamlessly with visible rock stratification. Represents immutable or foundational code infrastructure."

**Key Elements:**
- Rock base: #808080 (gray)
- Peaks: #C0C0C0 (silver)
- Snow caps: #FFFAFA (snow white)
- Shadows: #2F4F4F (dark slate gray)

## Technical Requirements for All Tiles:
- **Format**: PNG with transparency where applicable
- **Edges**: Must align perfectly for seamless tiling
- **Lighting**: Consistent top-left light source
- **Saturation**: 70-80% to avoid eye strain
- **Detail Level**: Enough to be interesting, not so much it's distracting at scale

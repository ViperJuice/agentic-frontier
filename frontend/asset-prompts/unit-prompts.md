# Agent Unit Sprite Prompts for Agentic Frontier

## Art Style Guidelines
- **Perspective**: Top-down view with slight character visibility
- **Size**: 64x64 pixels (character should be ~32x32 within this)
- **Style**: Cute, low-poly, robotic/digital aesthetic
- **Animation Ready**: Clear directional facing (at least front view)
- **Theme**: Digital agents exploring code landscapes

## 1. Worker Agent (`unit_worker.png`)
**Prompt:**
"Create a 64x64 pixel sprite of a small robotic worker character viewed from above at a slight angle. The robot should be golden/yellow colored (#FFD700) with a cubic/boxy design. It should have small mechanical arms holding tiny tools, LED eyes that glow blue, and tank treads or wheels for movement. The character should be centered in the frame, approximately 32x32 pixels in size. Low-poly, friendly appearance. Include a subtle shadow beneath. This represents a Claude AI agent performing code modifications."

**Key Features:**
- Primary color: #FFD700 (gold)
- LED eyes: #00FFFF (cyan)
- Tools: #C0C0C0 (silver)
- Shadow: 20% opacity black
- Personality: Industrious, friendly

## 2. Explorer Agent (`unit_explorer.png`)
**Prompt:**
"Design a 64x64 pixel sprite of a robotic explorer/scanner unit from a top-down perspective. The robot should be primarily blue (#4169E1) with a sleek, aerodynamic design. Features include a rotating radar dish or antenna on top, multiple sensor arrays (small glowing dots), and hover jets or legs for movement. Center the ~32x32 pixel character in the frame. Low-poly style with glowing accents. Include a soft shadow. This represents an AI agent searching and analyzing code."

**Key Features:**
- Primary color: #4169E1 (royal blue)
- Sensor lights: #00FF00 (lime green)
- Antenna: #E5E5E5 (light gray)
- Glow effects: Subtle pulse
- Personality: Curious, analytical

## 3. Builder Agent (`unit_builder.png`)
**Prompt:**
"Create a 64x64 pixel sprite of a construction/builder robot viewed from above. The robot should be orange (#FF8C00) with a sturdy, industrial design. Include a small crane arm or manipulator, construction lights, heavy-duty treads, and a storage compartment visible on its back. The character should be ~32x32 pixels centered in the frame. Low-poly aesthetic with mechanical details. Add a drop shadow. This represents an AI agent creating new code structures."

**Key Features:**
- Primary color: #FF8C00 (dark orange)
- Warning lights: #FFFF00 (yellow)
- Mechanical arms: #696969 (dim gray)
- Construction details: Visible bolts/panels
- Personality: Strong, creative

## Visual Consistency Requirements:
- **Lighting**: Top-down with slight front illumination
- **Shadow**: Consistent drop shadow at 20% opacity
- **Scale**: All units same relative size (~32x32 within 64x64)
- **Style**: Chunky, geometric shapes with rounded edges
- **Details**: Enough to distinguish role, not overwhelming

## Animation Considerations:
- Design should work for 4-directional movement
- Clear "front" of unit for orientation
- Moveable parts (treads, arms) should be distinct
- LED/lights can pulse for idle animation
- Keep design symmetrical enough for easy rotation

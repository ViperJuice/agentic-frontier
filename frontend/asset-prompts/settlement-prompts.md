# Settlement Sprite Prompts for Agentic Frontier

## Art Style Guidelines
- **Perspective**: Isometric/top-down view
- **Size**: 64x64 pixels
- **Style**: Futuristic micro-cities representing code files
- **Growth**: Visual progression from small to large
- **Theme**: Digital settlements in a code landscape

---

## 1. Small Settlement (`settlement_small.png`)
**Prompt:**
"Create a 64x64 pixel isometric sprite of a small futuristic settlement representing a small code file (<100 lines). The settlement consists of 2-3 small, cubic buildings with glowing windows, connected by thin energy conduits or data streams. Buildings should be low (1-2 stories) with flat or slightly angled roofs featuring solar panels or antenna arrays. Use a brown/bronze color scheme (#8B4513) with cyan accents for windows and energy. Include a small central plaza with a data fountain or holographic display. Low-poly style with clean edges."

**Key Features:**
- Building color: #8B4513 (saddle brown)
- Window glow: #00FFFF (cyan)
- Size: 2-3 small structures
- Height: 1-2 stories
- Special: Small data fountain/node in center

## 2. Medium Settlement (`settlement_medium.png`)
**Prompt:**
"Design a 64x64 pixel isometric sprite of a medium-sized digital settlement representing a moderate code file (100-500 lines). Features 5-7 buildings of varying heights (2-4 stories) arranged around a central hub. Buildings have a more sophisticated design with visible structural framework, glowing data panels, and rooftop communication arrays. Color scheme uses darker brown (#A0522D) with more prominent blue/cyan lighting. Include visible data highways between buildings and a central tower with a rotating beacon. Low-poly aesthetic with more architectural detail."

**Key Features:**
- Building color: #A0522D (sienna)
- Data streams: #1E90FF (dodger blue)
- Size: 5-7 structures
- Height: 2-4 stories
- Special: Central communication tower

---

## 3. Large Settlement (`settlement_large.png`)
**Prompt:**
"Create a 64x64 pixel isometric sprite of a large, advanced settlement representing a major code file (500+ lines). Dense cluster of 10-12 buildings including several tall towers (4-6 stories) with complex architectural details. Features multiple levels of walkways, data bridges connecting buildings, holographic billboards, and a prominent central skyscraper with a data beacon. Use rich brown tones (#654321) with extensive blue/cyan lighting networks. Include particle effects for data flow, landing pads on roofs, and a protective energy shield dome outline. Detailed low-poly style showing a thriving digital metropolis."

**Key Features:**
- Building color: #654321 (dark brown)
- Energy network: #00CED1 (dark turquoise)
- Size: 10-12 structures
- Height: Mix, up to 6 stories
- Special: Central skyscraper with beacon, shield dome

---

## Visual Consistency:
- **Foundation**: All settlements on hexagonal or circular base platform
- **Lighting**: Consistent cyan/blue for technology elements
- **Growth**: Clear visual progression in complexity
- **Data Flow**: Visible energy/data streams between buildings
- **Activity**: Animated elements (blinking lights, rotating beacons)

## File Type Variations (Color Overlays):
When these settlements are used in-game, they'll be tinted based on file type:
- JavaScript (.js): Golden tint (#F7DF1E)
- TypeScript (.ts): Blue tint (#3178C6)
- Python (.py): Blue/yellow tint (#3776AB)
- Markdown (.md): Dark blue tint (#083FA1)
- JSON: Dark/black tint (#000000)

Design should work well with color overlays while maintaining detail visibility.
